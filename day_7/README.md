# Day 7 - Build a Thing!

Congrats on making it through the first 6 days of Mod 0! Today, you will be putting together all that you have learned so far to actually build a program - hopefully this will help show you everything you have already accomplished in your first week as a programmer!

When you have completed the activities for day 7 you will submit your work through a GitHub Pull Request - see below for instructions on how to do that.

## Open your local copy of frontend-mod-1-prework
1. Using your terminal, open the local copy of the repository that you created during setup.  To do this, you will need to use the terminal command `cd` to change into the directory that holds the repository - if you followed the suggested directory structure from the setup, you should be able to run the following command from your home directory `cd turing/0module/frontend-mod-1-prework`. Once you are in the correct directory, use the terminal command `atom .` to open the repository in Atom.

1. Using what you have learned in the last week, complete both of the projects below. Put any files related to the projects you choose in a day_7 directory.

    1. [FizzBuzz](./fizzbuzz.md) **required completed**
    1. [10 Speckled Frogs](./10_speckled_frogs.md) **required completed**

1. When you are finished with your projects, you should add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub.

1. Add a `high_level.md` file to your day_7 directory. In that file, write up high level notes about how you would solve one of the following problems. When you're finished writing your detailed notes, you can also choose to code a solution to the problem(s).

    1. [Ceasar Cipher](./ceasar_cipher.md)
    1. [Checker Board](./checker_board.md)

1. When you are finished with your high level explanation, you should add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub.

You should now be able to log in to GitHub, navigate to your remote prework repository and see all the work you did today!

## Submission

Be sure to include links for your Gear Up pre-work gist and your technical pre-work GitHub repository. The link to your technical pre-work GitHub repository will be in the format https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/frontend-mod-1-prework. (using your own GitHub username, of course!)
