## Ceasar Cipher

1. Based on the parameter that the js program needs to respond to any string and shift value entered by a user, I need to create an object. 
* The user's interaction will thus be considered an instance of the object.
2. I will create a class with the following constructors of str and num so the user might create their instance. 
3. Then, a method will be included that will iterate through the str.length and shift the letters used based on the userShift value. 
* This includes first breaking the string into individual letters while ignoring spaces and iterating through each letter and shifting.
* Then once it's shifted, the array needs to reform into a single string. 
* The necessary letter's must be capitalized.
* The necessary spaces need to be included to maintain meaning.
