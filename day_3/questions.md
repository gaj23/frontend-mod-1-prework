## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
> A conditional statement explains what needs to happen if certain conditions are met during a situation. For example: If I identify a bird, I can log it in ebird. Looking more towards web applications for examples, though, the login to any site is an example of a conditional statement. If I enter in my information correctly, I can login. If I don't, I'm asked to try again or blocked from the site. 

2. Why might you want to use an `if` statement?
> Having an "if" statement will allow flexibility and variablity to be accounted for in the code. Humans might interact with the code in unexpected ways and the if statements will be helpful in responding accordingly. 

3. What is the JavaScript syntax for an `if` statement?
```if (bananas = "delicious"); { 
        console.log("I think so too!");
}
```
4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement?
> To add multiple conditions to an "if" statement would require the use of the "else if" statement which would allow for multiple conditions/answers to be accounted for when interacting with the code. 

5. What is the JavaScript syntax for an `if/else` statement?
```
if (bananas = "delicious") {
    console.log("I think so too!");
} else {
    console.log("I'm so sorry to hear that you don't like bananas!");
}
```
6. Other than an `if` statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
> A conditional statement such as: "When x, y, and z happen, then XYZ happens" is another example of a conditional statement besides an "if" statement.
